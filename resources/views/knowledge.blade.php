        <p>While approximately 13% of women reported smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy, prevalence was in excess of 20% in women with less than 12 years of education;

        </p>
        <p>High prevalence of smoking among the uninsured and those receiving Medicaid</p>
        <p>	Reductions in smoking in many environments have resulted in lowering of blood levels of cotinine, a marker of smoke exposure, by 70% in non-smokers from 1988–1991 through 2001–2002</p>
        <p>	The Surgeon General’s Report [6] lists among its many findings that secondhand smoke causes reduced birthweight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and suggests a relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and preterm birth as well as childhood cancer</p>
        <p>	A recent review and meta-analysis of the effects of secondhand smoke on birth outcomes reported associations of exposure with reduced birthweight (by 37–40 g), and 20% increased risk of low birthweight (LBW; <2500 g)</p>
        <p>	An estimated 5.9% of U.S. high school students (10.5% of boys and 1.2% of girls) were current users of smokeless tobacco products in 2004</p>
        <p>	Studies in India, where smokeless tobacco use far exceeds smoking among women in some populations, found increases in stillbirths and lower birthweight in offspring of mothers using chewing tobacco</p>
        <p>	Gupta and Sreevidya [30] found that use of smokeless tobacco during pregnancy was associated with an average reduction of 105 g in birthweight and 6.2 days in gestation length.</p>
        <p>	Use of Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in pregnant women is highly controversial; there have been few studies of NRT in pregnant women, and to date there is no evidence that NRT is effective in improving cessation of smoking among pregnant women</p>
        <p>	Nicotine is arguably the most damaging chemical exposure to the embryo and fetus from maternal smoking, affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system. Scientists concerned about the developmental toxicity of nicotine have argued strongly against any use of NRT in pregnancy</p>
        <p>	Nicotine is clearly a neuroteratogen, impacting the brain at critical developmental stages [37], and is the most likely cause of cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems seen in children of smokers</p>
        <p>	Nicotine binds to receptors through which developmentally important signaling occurs in many developing organs and tissues in addition to the central nervous system</p>
        <h2>	Spontaneous abortion</h2>
        <p>	In a population-based case–control study in Sweden, women were categorized by plasma cotinine concentration as non-exposed (<0.1 ng cotinine/ml plasma), environmental tobacco smoke-exposed (0.1–15 ng/ml) or active smokers (>15 ng/ml). The risk of spontaneous abortion was increased among both ETS-exposed women (adjusted odds ratio 1.67 [95% CI 1.17–2.38] and active smokers (adjusted odds ratio 2.11 [95% CI 1.36–3.27]</p>
        <h2>Effects on the placenta</h2>
        <p>Maternal smoking alters the blood flow to the placenta and changes the balance between proliferation and differentiation of the cytotrophoblast.</p>
        <p>Changes seen in the placentas of smokers were present in less severe form in women exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy</p>
        <p>Cadmium, a constituent of tobacco smoke known to accumulate in the placenta, has been shown to inhibit the activity of the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-β-HSD2) as well as decrease 11-β-HSD2 mRNA and protein in cultured human trophoblast cells [49]. Reduction in 11-β-HSD2 activity in the placenta has been associated with decreased intrauterine growth</p>
        <p>Placental abruption, the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta before delivery, occurs in about 1% of pregnancies….maternal smoking has been associated with a 90% increase in risk of placental abruption (odds ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.8–2.0])</p>
        <p>Maternal smoking has been associated with placenta previa, which is the implantation of the placenta over or near the internal os of the cervix. As labor approaches, partial detachment and severe vaginal bleeding may result.
            The odds ratios for increased risk of placenta previa with maternal smoking ranged from 2.6 to 4.4, despite controlling for confounders.
